<div><p>Many people were surprised at Paul Manafort’s relatively light sentencing for bank fraud, filing fake tax returns, and failure to report foreign assets and compared his sentence of 47 months to other cases of seemingly lesser crimes given longer prison terms. A <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottHech/status/1103809139900407808">viral tweet thread</a> from public defender Scott Hechinger began:</p>
<blockquote><p>For context on Manafort’s 47 months in prison, my client yesterday was offered 36-72 months in prison for stealing $100 worth of quarters from a residential laundry room.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anecdotes, however, run the risk of misleading if they are not representative. The Bureau of Justice Statistics just released <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/tssp16.pdf">Time Served in State Prison 2016</a>. Stealing laundry quarters sounds like larceny (no break in). The average time served for larceny was 17 months and the median time served was 11 months.</p>
<p>Hechinger also notes this <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottHech/status/1103813319771783168">outrageous case</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>15 years in prison for drug possession. You shouldn’t need more info than that to be outraged. But then learn: Juanita is a mother of 6. Her 18 year old is now head of household. Raising 5 kids. Crime is not even a felony in Oklahoma anymore.</p></blockquote>
<p>The average time served for drug possession was 15 months and the median time 10 months. Arguably too long but a far cry from 15 years.</p>
<p>For a serious violent crime like robbery, taking property by force or threat of force, the average time served was considerably higher, 4.7 years and the median time served 3.2 years.</p>
<p>You can see the table below for more data. Judge for yourselves, but for most crimes mean and median time served don’t seem to me to be obviously too high. Moreover, keep in mind that most crimes do not result in an arrest let alone a conviction or time served.</p>
<p>In 2017, for example, victims reported <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv17.pdf">2,000,990 serious violent crimes</a> (rape or sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault). In the same year there were approximately <a href="https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/explorer/national/united-states/arrest/2007/2017">446,510 arrests</a> for these crimes (crime definitions may not line up exactly). In other words, the chance of being arrested for a serious violent crime was only 22%. Data on convictions are harder to obtain but convictions are far fewer than arrests. In 2006 (most up-to-date data I could find but surely <em>lower</em> today) there were <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fssc06st.pdf">175,500 convictions for serious violent crimes</a>. Thus, considerably fewer than 10% of violent crimes result in a conviction (175,500/2,000,990=8.7%).</p>
<p>Put differently, the expected time served for a <em>serious violent crime</em> is less than 14 months. Do you want to <em>reduce</em> expected time served? What I would like to do is put more police on the street to <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/09/what-was-gary-beckers-biggest-mistake.html">increase the certainty of arrest and conviction</a>. If we double the conviction rate, I’d happily halve time served.</p>
<p>I support decriminalization of many crimes, shorter sentences for some crimes and fewer scarlet letter punishments. I want to reduce bias and variability in the criminal justice system. But I do not want to return to the crime rates of the past. Even as crime rates fall, we should be careful about declaring the war won and going home. We are <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=police+prisons">under policed</a> in the United States and despite anecdotes that rightly shock the conscience, <strong>average</strong> time served is not that high, especially given very low arrest and conviction rates.</p>

<p>I wish Hechinger had indicated whether his client had any prior offences.  That's relevant in sentencing, along with other prior "relevant conduct".  The criminal defense lawyer plays a major role in providing evidence and argument at the sentencing hearing.  Perhaps Hechinger should share some of the blame for what he claims is disparate and/or too-harsh treatment of his client?</p>
<p>I don't think a tweet is the proper forum for evaluating sentences or verdicts.  Tabarrok seems to at least understand that, although I don't think blogs are much better .  If you really want to second guess judges and juries, which get to see a lot more of the facts relevant to the decisions we entrust them to make, perhaps you should delve into the specific matter just as deeply, or more so, than they did.  I've observed a worrisome tendency among not only MSM but also the blogosphere to try to litigate cases in public without all the relevant facts.  How responsible is that?</p>

<p>Another point about this tweet, which I originally overlooked:</p>
<p>"For context on Manafort’s 47 months in prison, my client yesterday was offered 36-72 months in prison for stealing $100 worth of quarters from a residential laundry room."</p>
<p>Given the language used "my client was offered..." leads me to believe that this was simply an offer made by the prosecutor in return for a guilty plea.  Sentences handed down after trial are not "offered", they are "given".  If it is indeed the case that this was a plea offer, then Counselor Hechinger can take his client to trial and argue for a lower sentence.  Not sure he's going to win points with the prosecutor's office for trying to litigate his client's case in the court of public opinion.</p>

<p>Finally, how does one get 36 to 72 months in prison for what appears to be a Class A Misdemeanorin New York  (theft under $1,000) if the description in the tweet if the full story about the charge(s)?  There appears to be a lot more to this than meets the tweet:</p>

<p>Often there is more disinformation in these examples than information.  More than likely it wasn't simple "drug possession" but something much worse that was bargained down to a lessor crime.  More than likely it wasn't simply steal quarters.  While there should be more equitable and appropriate sentencing it is misleading to give examples while hiding information.  </p>
<p>As for Manafort, the real issue here is the left wants to so badly harm him that no one will ever again dare to work with a Republican presidential candidate.  This is a total misuse of our legal system for political reasons.  The prosecutors under Mueller have a history of criminal misuse of their powers and they themselves should be brought to justice.</p>

<p>Well, I have changed just one word - want to guess which one it is?</p>
<p>'...  wants to so badly harm him that no one will ever again dare to work with a Ukrainian presidential candidate.'</p>
<p>Manafort's convictions have nothing to do with his work involving any Republican. But if you want to say that Republican operatives should be more deeply involved with pro-Putin individuals, well, would anyone be surprised?</p>

<p>On the contrary, Manafort is guilty of two "political" crimes (unspecified in the indictments but the reasons he is going to prison).  He worked for a short period on Trump's 2016 election campaign and Mueller couldn't find anything Manafort did Russia-related.  </p>

<p>'but the reasons he is going to prison'</p>
<p>The reasons he is going to prison involve documented bank and tax fraud.</p>
<p>The second judge to sentence him put it fairly succintly, actually - “This defendant is not public enemy number one, but he’s also not a victim either. There’s no question this defendant knew better, and he knew exactly what he was doing.”</p>

<p>When I read it, I thought, 'fake news'.  You don't get three years for stealing quarters, unless there's something more.</p>
<p>If you're interested in how things work in real life, I can suggest the terrific 'Serial' and 'Crimetown' podcasts.  'Serial' Season 3 deals with daily justice in the Cleveland criminal court system, and it is absolutely appalling on any number of levels.  </p>
<p>If you're going on a long car trip, I highly recommend downloading a bunch of episodes.  They are both entertaining and enlightening.  Fantastic  journalism.</p>

<p>The $100 of quarters was a burgarly charge because it was unlawful entry into a residential building.  In other words a serious felony, no matter the poor haul.</p>

<p>Possibly, but not clear from the tweet.  Felony burglary sounds a lot more serious than “stealing 100 dollars worth of quarters”!</p>

<p>There's no way it could be anything other than burglary. If the residential laundry room was open to the public, hence no breaking and entering, and a jar of quarters was just sitting there for communal use, there would be no crime in taking it, except being a jerk. The most likely scenario is the guy broke into an apartment building to steal something, couldn't find anything, and decided to make off with the fat jar of quarters in frustration.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a $100 jar of quarters lying around in a laundry room?  I haven't.</p>
<p>I think the implication is that he jacked the washing and drying (or change) machines and took the money out of them, ie, burglary.</p>

<p>Of course, it's white collar crime that's rarely even prosecuted much less punished. Here's the link to the obituary of William Powers, who wrote the report that lead to the Enron scandal and the prosecution of its chairman and CEO and the collapse of the company: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/obituaries/william-powers-dead.html  The timing of his death is ironic, not only because of the current investigation and prosecution of white collar criminals associated with Trump but the scandal regarding fraud in elite college admissions. Read the obituary. It sheds an entirely different light on the second scandal.</p>

<p>@rayward - William C. Powers Jr. was a typical liberal college administrator, see blurb below, looking out for his university, and arguably committing criminal acts himself.  And Enron, though it inflated profits like everybody else back then, has had its investments pay off over the years (Google this). </p>
<p>NY Times: "The previous year, his adversaries had backed an investigation into reports that Mr. Powers had pressed for dozens of students who were well-connected but who had poor grades to be admitted to the university over the objections of the admissions staff.</p>
<p>The investigation found in early 2015 that he had admitted 73 such students over six years. He acknowledged doing so, but defended their admission, saying that the students’ families knew wealthy donors and lawmakers who controlled state funding for the university, and that admitting them would benefit the university in the long run."</p>

<p>That's super low. Arrests for violent crimes in France is 75%. But it goes down to 15% for non violent robberies. The United States is underpoliced but also police forces do not prioritize correctly between violent and non-violent crimes.</p>

<p>One way to circumvene that problem is to make all violent crimes federal crimes and having a federal police force investigate all these crimes. The US government will probably have to hire 50,000 to 100,000 for this new agency.</p>

<p>Nice stat.  Arrests for crime in Japan is nearly 100%, as are conviction rates.  Does our host want the USA to become like Japan, with persecution of foreign corporate officers over boardroom power plays, as in the case of the Renault Alliance CEO Carlos Ghosn?  If crime rates have dropped in the USA, as they have, and are approaching Japanese levels, we need less police, not more (except for ghettos of course). </p>
<p>The USA is not Brazil, which has high crime. (troll bait)</p>

<p>"Arrests for crime in Japan is nearly 100%, as are conviction rates"</p>
<p>The former is absolutely untrue, because the Japanese police usually do not act on crimes which are difficult to solve and instead put a lot of effort into obtaining confessions. The latter, though, is: prosecutors in Japan only take cases which are slam dunks.</p>

<p>Policemen are a commodity like any other and subject to marginal utility. The first ten policemen hired by a new town are very important people. When the 516th patrolman is sworn in he is much less important. There is a number of cops after which each addition is of little value in preventing or investigating crime.</p>

<p>But the relevant number isn't really police per capita, it's police per crime. And arrests per crime. And then it's not clear the US is such an outlier, on crude numbers, it just has lots of violence to respond to.</p>

<p>It would be great to see the data on the length of sentences vs actual time served, especially since  Hechinger's anecdotes were only comparing sentences. As Vivian pointed out, many factors can influence sentencing— just as many factors will influence parole reviews. (Unfortunately, a cursory search didn't find much data on sentencing vs. time served.)</p>

<p>Time served is almost always way less than time sentenced and providing the data on only one to counter the point that another is too short is completely silly.</p>

<p>The anecdotes are helpful because they are representative of the right tail. When you see mean values 50% greater than median (drug cases for example), it shows something weird is going on in the extremes. That makes the following sentence from Alex the important one:  "I want to reduce bias and variability in the criminal justice system."</p>

<p>No, they are misinformative because  all else is not held equal. The right tail is filled with repeat offenders, aggravating factors, lack of mitigating factors, additional charges, idiosyncrasies of the judges and jurisdictions, and many other factors that widen the distribution for the same crime.</p>
<p>There is close to a 100% probability that this lawyer isn't telling us the whole story.</p>

<p>"In 2017, for example, victims reported 2,000,990 serious violent crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault)."</p>
<p>I think it's a bit misleading to cite the figure provided by the NCVS without providing the UCR numbers. Among other differences, the NCVS is based on self-reported data, which means that the number above is likely higher than the actual number of serious violent crimes committed (i.e. people may see themselves as the victim of a crime when in fact they are not, people remember events differently, etc.).<br/>
The UCR, however, only includes crimes actually reported to police, which means that the UCR data is likely less than the number of actual violent crimes committed because not every crime is reported to the police.</p>
<p>I think any attempt to provide a concrete, definite number of crimes committed during any single period needs to incorporate the data from both of these sources.</p>

<p>'How Much Time Do Criminals Really Serve?'</p>
<p>Why not compare the amounts involved?</p>
<p>Manafort defrauded two banks 4.4 million dollars, and the U.S. government of the taxes due on 16 million dollars of income.</p>
<p>If someone directly stole millions of dollars in repeated acts of larceny (remember, we also need to keep in mind that Manafort was found guilty of multiple charges, not just one), do you honestly think the average time served for repeated acts of larceny would be 17 months and the median time served 11 months?</p>
<p>Or to put it differently, in just one case he was found guilty of seven acts equivalent to larceny with the total amount in the multiple millions, and he is certainly serving less than 102 months, if one did a simplistic multiplication of the sentence for one act of larceny. </p>
<p>(And as note, because we certainly don't want to let propaganda infect our decisions, federal crimes and sentences are not the same as state ones - broadly speaking, federal offenses are more serious, and carry heavier penalties. To be honest, that might not be part of the American citizenship test, and the American system can be confusing, even when one grows up in another country with a federal system.)</p>

<p>Do note that the important word in the following - 'In the end, Buchwald did offer some leniency. She had the option to go as high as 20 years for convictions on three counts of wire fraud, one count of bank fraud, and one count of lying to investigators. Instead, she allowed his different sentences to be served concurrently, meaning he’ll receive six years in prison, as well as three years of supervised release.' <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/10/bily-mcfarland-fyre-festival-sentencing/">https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/10/bily-mcfarland-fyre-festival-sentencing/</a></p>
<p>He received more than 6 years, but the judge decided on a shorter actual jail term. Manafort, whose actions earned him no sympathy from two separate judges (after all, he was put into jail before his convictions due to those actions, though he will receive credit for time served), was not as lucky.</p>
<p>Basically, Prof. Tabarrok ignored completely just how Manafort's own actions pushed him into a situation where longer sentencing than otherwise was essentially unavoidable. </p>
<p>Though Manafort and his attorneys just might have a strategy to ensure that Manafort will not serve his sentence - '“The ‘no collusion’ refrain that runs through the entire defense memorandum is unrelated to matters at hand,” Jackson said, adding: “The ‘no collusion’ mantra is simply a non-sequitur." After all, she pointed out, the investigation isn’t over. It’s worth noting, too, that one hearing related to Manafort involved a lawyer for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III arguing that a particular meeting in which Manafort was involved got to “the heart” of Mueller’s investigation — which is centered on the question of coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>
<p>After Jackson’s sentence was imposed, Manafort’s attorney Kevin Downing spoke briefly to reporters outside the courthouse.</p>
<p>“For anyone who was in the courtroom today, what I’m about to say will not be a surprise," Downing said. “Judge Jackson conceded that there was absolutely no evidence of any Russian collusion in this case, so that makes two courts, two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians."</p>
<p>That’s not what Jackson said, as people nearby quickly pointed out, but the message was sent: The president who on 226 occasions has specifically stated that there was no collusion could now proudly tweet Downing’s words. And, who knows, maybe show a little appreciation to Downing’s client for making that point.</p>
<p>What sort of appreciation? Well, the crimes for which Manafort has been sentenced were all federal crimes, and Trump has the power to pardon any person who has committed federal crimes.' <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/13/paul-manafort-tried-send-message-trump-manhattans-da-may-have-rendered-it-moot/?utm_term=.89efb519976e">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/13/paul-manafort-tried-send-message-trump-manhattans-da-may-have-rendered-it-moot/?utm_term=.89efb519976e</a></p>

<p>Where did Alex argue the sentence for Manafort was appropriate? The point of the post was that to compare it to outrageous examples is, well, outrageous. </p>
<p>I would agree with you that if you are assessing whether Manafort got off lightly, dollar amounts matter. As Alex pointed out, "The average time served for larceny was 17 months and the median time served was 11 months." Manafort got more than this, but likely the average amount stolen was less than his crime, so the comparison would likely have Manafort being sentenced very lightly. But the point of the post wasn't about Manafort: he was only mentioned in the beginning because people use him to bring up examples from the tail of the distribution as if they were representative. That is bad practice, and that is what the post was clearly saying...</p>

<p>Nice chart, but AlexT's plea of: "But I do not want to return to the crime rates of the past" is ludicrous, since to return to the crime rates of the past, the USA has to somehow magically become much younger again.</p>
<p>I'm against mandatory sentencing.  For example, I forgot to file a certain IRS form for when you have lots of foreign assets in overseas banks (usually I stay below the $300k limit but I inherited a bunch of money from my uncle and forgot about this IRS rule) even though I file the FBAR form every year.  Should I go to jail?  With mandatory sentencing, if that was the case, I might, if some overzealous prosecutor wants resume fame by saying "I busted Ray Lopez for money laundering, who's in the 1%".  Same with "three strikes" for harmless stuff like larceny (think of kleptomanias).  Also the only people who go to jail, seems to me, are ones who can't afford a good lawyer.</p>

<p>I've read (but do not have a reference) that its pretty common for a person to be convicted of one crime, e.g. drug possession, which is readily provable, when its pretty clear that they are actually guilty of one or more others (significant drug trafficking, assault, etc.).  This is coupled with the very high (&gt;95% IIRC) fraction of plea bargains.</p>
<p>All of which just goes to say that one has to be careful about drawing strong conclusions from a cursory examination of the data.</p>

<p>If people being jailed for drug possession or robbery but those are actually just pretexts for much more serious crimes, doesn't that support OP's point that if anything jail terms are *too* lenient? If all these people serving a year and a half for robbery are actually there because police/judges/juries think they committed murder but can't quite prove it, such short prison terms don't seem like a good thing...</p>

<p>Conviction rates in Japan are 100%.  In Singapore they have a corporal punishment.</p>
<p>I know we aren't prepared for the image of black dudes getting whipped, but you could end much of the crime in America if arrest rates and conviction rates were high and harsh corporal punishment was used.  This would reduce the need for imprisonment.</p>

<p>That's true, if the prosecutor is not overzealous.  If they are, then you and I, normal people, can catch the brunt of their wrath.  The USA over the years has become like Japan, in that if the government wants to get you (Ghosn is the latest example in JP), they can.  RICO type laws,  "money laundering" laws and "process crimes" are the ways US prosecutors get you (a couple of US prosecutors over the years have even lost their license to practice law as well as in one case, NC, I think, gone to jail).  As well as "cheating on taxes".  They nailed Al Capone this way, but nowadays they can nail anybody reading this blog.  Who here hasn't cheated on taxes by under-reporting something or another?  AlexT wants more police but I, having studied law in the sausage factory, want even less.  They don't have effective police in Greece or the Philippines and it's not so bad.  Just the the families fight it out, vendetta style, it works.</p>

<p>In a Beckerian model of crime, because arrest and conviction are uncertain prospects, the punishment must be substantially higher than the benefit of crime in order to act as a deterrent. The easier it is to get away with it, the higher the punishment should be, all else equal.</p>
<p>In my lifetime I've watched average sentences plunge and records get scrubbed.  Our legal system has almost no deterrent value for those most likely to commit crimes. Indeed, one could argue that prison is a beneficial experience for some criminals, or at least there are some benefits that mitigate the costs.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm sure a lawyer would never lie for attention.    And I'm sure if this was his client's twenty-third offense, and he destroyed property to get the money, and was carrying a gun and fentanyl and the time, while abandoning a child at home and then resisting arrest, he'd be VERY upfront with those facts in his tweet about "stealing quarters."</p>
<p>As for Manafort, at this point, you almost have to feel bad for the douchebag.    He cleanly got away stealing millions of dollars a long time ago.   But why was we arrested?    </p>
<p>Solely because, years later, he ran Trump's campaign for ten minutes and got swept up in the Democrat Hate Machine.</p>

<p>All else equal, the wealthier and higher-status someone is, the more punishing a given prison sentence will be. It's kind of like diminishing marginal utility of money, but in the opposite direction. Wealthier people have more to lose. The underclass might not care if you've been to prison (They might even see it as a status marker) but if an upper class person spends a nontrivial amount of time in prison this can utterly destroy any and all future career prospects. </p>
<p>Consequently, if we care about _equal_ justice for all, then all else equal, wealthier and more powerful members of society should serve smaller jail sentences than poorer and less powerful members of society, because those poorer members of society receive 100% of their punishment via jail time while the richer members of society receive their punishment as (say) 10% jail time and 90% destroyed career prospects</p>

<p>So we need fewer taboos, fewer sanctions, but more surveillance, more cops and more fear of them.</p>

<p>"15 years in prison for drug possession. You shouldn’t need more info than that to be outraged. But then learn: Juanita is a mother of 6. Her 18 year old is now head of household. Raising 5 kids."</p>
<p>That's the plot of "Shameless."</p>

<p>Not sure why you'd want to halve the time served? Then you wouldn't actually be reducing the average population of criminals roaming the streets, so what's the point?</p>
<p>Violent criminals don't reform, and to the extent that they do, we don't know why. Once you've committed a heinous crime, you should be in prison at least until you may have "aged out" of criminal behavior.</p>

<p>"Juanita Peralta, an inmate serving 10 years for possession of a controlled substance. <i>She has previously served time for possession of a controlled substance,  possession with intent to distribute and carrying drugs or a weapon into jail.</i>" https://kfor.com/2018/10/17/oklahomans-for-criminal-justice-reform-fighting-for-commutations-for-current-inmates/</p>
<p>So spare us the sob story. She deserved to be charged with child endangerment. She's currently an unfit mother and perhaps some prison time will induce her to get her act together.</p>

<p>Well, Siberian yuppie party-goer <a href="https://nailheadtom.blogspot.com/2018/12/maria-butina-after-spending-almost-half.html">Maria Butina </a>has been in solitary confinement  since July, was offered and accepted a plea for being an unregistered foreign agent and still resides in a cell alone. But she'll probably be sentenced to return to Putin's Hell on Earth sometime in the future.</p>

<p>Yet she is still alive, which puts her ahead of Magnistky - 'Sergei Leonidovich Magnitsky was a Russian investigative lawyer who specialized in anti-corruption activities. His arrest in 2008 and subsequent death after eleven months in police custody generated international media attention and triggered both official and unofficial inquiries into allegations of fraud, theft, and human rights violations in Russia.' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky</a></p>
