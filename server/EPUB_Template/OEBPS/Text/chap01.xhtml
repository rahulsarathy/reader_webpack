<p>The local cat lady coalition is building a new homeless shelter. For cats.</p>
<p>My mother often complains about stray cats on her property. She says that back in her day, any critter that wasn’t tied down or locked up would be summarily thrown in a stewpot. Then again, she grew up during Chairman Mao’s Famine. No need for feral cat shelters back then, I bet.</p>
<p>The only thing cats have going for them is their supernormal resemblance to human infants. Their innocent wide eyes, their mewling cries, their unrelenting selfishness. By acting like human babies, cats trick childless women into adopting them as their own.</p>

<p>This is exactly what a cuckoo bird does. A cuckoo is known as a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brood parasite</a></strong>; it relies on other species to raise its young. The female cuckoo lays eggs that mimic the host’s eggs, and when they hatch, the baby cuckoos grow faster and cry louder than the host’s babies. </p>

<p>In the wild, only 30% of baby songbirds survive to adulthood, so parents are motivated to feed the strongest birdlings first. The baby cuckoo quickly outgrows its adoptive siblings and pushes them out to die.</p>
<p>So it is with cats. <em>I’m not ready to settle down yet</em>, you think.<em> I’ll adopt a kitten for companionship. Just one won’t hurt</em>. Before you know it, you’re spending the next two decades paying for Fluffy’s food and heartworm meds, attending to her every meow. Maybe cat ownership isn’t the <strong>result</strong> of declining birthrates, but the <strong>cause</strong> of it.</p>
